            Ethiopodcast is a curated platform for discovering Ethiopian podcasts in one place. 
            We bring together podcasts covering culture, religion, politics, society, technology, education, 
            and everyday conversations so listeners don't have to search across multiple platforms to find relevant voices.
          </p>
          <p className="sub-text">
            Ethiopodcast does not produce podcasts. We organize, categorize, and surface existing shows 
            to make discovery simple and transparent.
